# gcd-django-vagrant-install
Scripts to setup a local development environment for the [Grand Comics Database](http://www.comics.org/) website ([gcd-django](https://github.com/GrandComicsDatabase/gcd-django/)) using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

After installing Vagrant, simply run

    vagrant up

in this directory and, after a little while, you should have a VirtualBox VM running a gcd-django development installation listening on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/) - simply visit this link to test it.

Preinstalled accounts are (username / password): admin / admin, editor / editme, test@comics.org / test.
